#Went back and reviewed the string comparison challenge with the houseplant input
#Realized that the comparison variables don't have to be declared at the beginning
#The program will compare the input to whatever, doesn't need a variable. Might be 
#better for ease of understanding and future maintenance though...
#This is the more streamlined code. Probably not necessary to put in this git but,
#did not want to forget that there's yet another way to do it.
