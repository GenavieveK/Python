#Given the time an even starts and the elapsed minutes, outputs event end time.

#user input for start time hour, start time minutes, and duration minutes.
hour = int(input("Starting time (hours): "))
mins = int(input("Starting time (minutes): "))
dura = int(input("Event duration (minutes): "))

#the hour input multiplied by the number of minutes in an hour added to the total minutes duration input, 
#added to the number of minutes in the time input.
total_mins = ((mins + (hour*60)+ dura))

#convert the total_mins to a time. Hour is total_mins divided (floor division) by 60 minutes in an hour
#then modulus 24 hours in a day.
hours_answer = ((total_mins // 60) % 24)

#total_minutes modulus 60 minutes in an hour
mins_answer = (total_mins % 60)

#output
print("The event will end at: ", hours_answer ,":", mins_answer)
